The convection-diffusion equation, also known as the advection-diffusion is used to describe many linear processes in the physical sciences. It is employed as a model for heat transfer and the dynamics of fluids and gases. This repository discuss about the interaction between non-linear convection processes and the diffusive viscous process.
